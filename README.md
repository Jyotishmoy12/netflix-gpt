Developed a Netflix clone with robust user \textbf{authentication} powered by Firebase, 
seamlessly integrated with the \textbf{TMDB API} for dynamic content loading, and enhanced with a multi-language feature. 
Elevating the user experience to unprecedented heights, I've employed Redux for superior state management.
 Tech: ReactJs, ReduxJs, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, TMDB API.
